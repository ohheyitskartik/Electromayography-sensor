# Electromyography-sensor
The following sensor design can amplify, filter &amp; rectify EMG potentials range between less than 50 Î¼V and up to 30 mV  to a 0-3V logic level compatible with arduino's and arm processors inbuilt adc logic level. Open Readme file for more info.

The above mentioned circuit contains :-
1) Differential Op-amp (G=110).
2) Active high pass-filter set at 106.6 Hz.
3) Active low pass-filter set at 1.97 KHz.
4) Active rectification to avoid any damage to your microcontroller from negative voltages.
5) A variable gain at end to control output voltage.
